Overview:
The Recipe Manager is a web-based CRUD application that allows users to manage their favorite recipes online. Users can create, read, edit, and delete recipes. Each recipe entry will include information such as the recipe name, ingredients, cooking instructions, preparation time, and category(e.g., dessert). The purpose of this application is to help users organize their recipes digitally, making it easy to access and update from any device. 

Objectives:
    -Use CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the web application
    -Use MongoDB as a database to store all recipes
    -Use Bootstrap and an EJS template for a clean look
    -Include a shared header and footer
    -Deploy on Render
    -Protect username/password using .env and .gitignore

Features:
    -Add recipes
    -Read recipes 
    -Edit recipes
    -Delete recipes

Where I used Bootstrap & Fontawesome:
I used bootstrap on the home page, about me page and contact me page. I used fontawesome for the buttons on the header and footer and on the add, edit and delete buttons. The rest of the code is from the lecture 9 & 10. I also did my own css.
